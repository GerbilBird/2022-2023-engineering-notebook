Engineering Notebook for 2022-2023 FTC Season
# Thursday 10/13/22 
We had a small discussion about our slide today since a few team members thought it was slow. We figured out that it would be more than fast enough, especially when we added our arm to the end of it. We also stabilized the linear slide at the center of the drive train, which was very unstable. Curry worked on coding the slide to move based on button input, while Jacob attached the robot arm to the slide, as well as making a few modifications with the dremel so the arm would rest at the bottom of the slide. 

# Tuesday - 10/11/22
Today we assembled the drive train in an H-shape, but tangled up the string when we tried to attach it in the center. Curry took it home with him and untangled and re-attached it.  


# Thursday - 10/6/22 
Not much was accomplished today; just the linear slide was threaded and completely assembled. 

# Tuesday -  10/4/22 
We had three groups working today, one assembling the linear slide, one working on the claw arm at the end of the slide, and one re-aligning the drive train. The linear slide was constructed based on the GoBuilda instructions for it. 

# Thursday - 9/29/22
We had no one taking notes today, which shall be remedied in the future. 

# Tuesday - 9/27/22
We explored ideas for our robotâ€™s arm and claw for this challenge. We decided to use a linear slide to extend the length we needed. We ended up with a few different designs, which included: 
Two semi-circular claw arms, which close in via servos.
Two high-grip wheels that grab and push the cone into a back plate.
Two plates, which one closes in on the other.
We ordered the part list for the year today, including motors, wires and cords, and our linear slide.

Today, all we did was disassemble the robot from the previous year. We did have a problem with stripped screws, which we had to drill out. In the future, we plan to get better screws.

Today our checklist is to finalize our strategy for how we will earn points in the competition. We started by assembling the field again with the entire team. After a visual look at the field, we worked on our strategy. 

**Autonomous**  - We will certainly use a custom signal sleeve instead of the provided sleeve. We plan to drop the preloaded cone on the shortest pole, navigate over the signal, read it and park in the right spot. 

**Driver Control**  - We will build the robot to be versatile and for it to be able to achieve most of the things it would need to do. Our current design includes using an arm to pick up from one end of the robot and deposit it on the other. We shall test once it is built and see which poles are more profitable to target. 

**End Game**  - Mostly the same as Driver Control, but we will decide where to put our beacons and finalize the circuits, which we shall work on throughout the game. 

Next meeting, we will dissemble the robot.

# Thursday - 9/15/2022
Today we assembled the new stage to get a feel for the field. We then worked on our strategy for the game. For our robot, we figure that keeping the same drive train as last year and using a linear slide to reach the high poles. We have a continuing debate about using drawer slides vs. buying a linear slide. We had to end our meeting 30 minutes early to take our stage apart. Next session, we will finish our strategy with the whole team.

# Tuesday - 9/13/2022 (First Meeting)
Today was a brainstorming session, and new members were added to Onshape. Before the next meeting, we decided that everyone should read Game Manual Pt. 2 and look over three websites, REV Robotics,  ServoCity, and AndyMark.
